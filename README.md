# **Receipt Processor**


Built a webservice that processes receipts and parses them to return reward points. This was built using Java in Spring Boot. 

## __Summary of APIs__

**Endpoint: Process Receipts**

* Path: /receipts/process
* Method: POST
* Payload: Receipt JSON
* Response: JSON containing an id for the receipt.

Description:

Takes in a JSON receipt and returns a JSON object with an ID generated by your code. The ID returned is the ID that should be passed into /receipts/{id}/points to get the number of points the receipt was awarded. 

```json
{ "id": "7fb1377b-b223-49d9-a31a-5a02701dd310" }
```

**Endpoint: Get Points**

* Path: /receipts/{id}/points
* Method: GET
* Response: A JSON object containing the number of points awarded.
* A simple Getter endpoint that looks up the receipt by the ID and returns an object specifying the points awarded.

Example Response:

```json
{ "points": 32 }
```

## __Rules__

These rules collectively define how many points should be awarded to a receipt.

* One point for every alphanumeric character in the retailer name.
* 50 points if the total is a round dollar amount with no cents.
* 25 points if the total is a multiple of 0.25.
* 5 points for every two items on the receipt.
* If the trimmed length of the item description is a multiple of 3, multiply the price by 0.2 and round up to the nearest integer. The result is the number of points earned.
* 6 points if the day in the purchase date is odd.
* 10 points if the time of purchase is after 2:00pm and before 4:00pm.

## __Examples__

```json
{
  "retailer": "Target",
  "purchaseDate": "2022-01-01",
  "purchaseTime": "13:01",
  "items": [
    {
      "shortDescription": "Mountain Dew 12PK",
      "price": "6.49"
    },{
      "shortDescription": "Emils Cheese Pizza",
      "price": "12.25"
    },{
      "shortDescription": "Knorr Creamy Chicken",
      "price": "1.26"
    },{
      "shortDescription": "Doritos Nacho Cheese",
      "price": "3.35"
    },{
      "shortDescription": "   Klarbrunn 12-PK 12 FL OZ  ",
      "price": "12.00"
    }
  ],
  "total": "35.35"
}
```
```
Total Points: 28
Breakdown:
     6 points - retailer name has 6 characters
    10 points - 5 items (2 pairs @ 5 points each)
     3 Points - "Emils Cheese Pizza" is 18 characters (a multiple of 3)
                item price of 12.25 * 0.2 = 2.45, rounded up is 3 points
     3 Points - "Klarbrunn 12-PK 12 FL OZ" is 24 characters (a multiple of 3)
                item price of 12.00 * 0.2 = 2.4, rounded up is 3 points
     6 points - purchase day is odd
  + ---------
  = 28 points
```

```json  
{
  "retailer": "M&M Corner Market",
  "purchaseDate": "2022-03-20",
  "purchaseTime": "14:33",
  "items": [
    {
      "shortDescription": "Gatorade",
      "price": "2.25"
    },{
      "shortDescription": "Gatorade",
      "price": "2.25"
    },{
      "shortDescription": "Gatorade",
      "price": "2.25"
    },{
      "shortDescription": "Gatorade",
      "price": "2.25"
    }
  ],
  "total": "9.00"
}
```
```
Total Points: 109
Breakdown:
    50 points - total is a round dollar amount
    25 points - total is a multiple of 0.25
    14 points - retailer name (M&M Corner Market) has 14 alphanumeric characters
                note: '&' is not alphanumeric
    10 points - 2:33pm is between 2:00pm and 4:00pm
    10 points - 4 items (2 pairs @ 5 points each)
  + ---------
  = 109 points
```

## __Validation__

There's some validation checks that the given receipt needs to adhere to or else it will result in a Bad Request Status. Every receipt must have all of its fields populated, none can be missing or null. The reason for this validation is
that realistically no receipt would have any of these missing if a purchase actually took place neither would there be a receipt if no purchase took place. 

## __How to run__

To run this application you should pull this repository and in Docker cd into this project. On the Docker terminal run the following command: 
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 receipt-processor:latest
```
After doing this you will be able to hit those enpoints on postman on localhost:8080.
